## Question

Hey guys, my friend is starting a gaming channelâ€”go sub to @AhjussiPlayz on Youtube!

## Approach
I searched for AhjussiPlayz in youtube and found a channel
It only had one video called "New Intro"

Ahjussi translated to middle-aged man in Korean, so i thought why not check subtitles in korean,
and there was it, after taking the text and translating to english, I got this message
"A big thank you to my good friend 'wimebix884' for helping me create the PS intro. Meet the up-and-coming singer, his new song!"

I then Used sherlock command on the username 'wimebix884'

There was an account in a website called Smule, in the about section, there was a google drive link which contained a MP3 file

when played, it dictated the flag character by character
